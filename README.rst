The Django Debug Toolbar is a configurable set of panels that display various
debug information about the current request/response and when clicked, display
more details about the panel's content.

Here's a screenshot of the toolbar in action:

In addition to the built-in panels, a number of third-party panels are
contributed by the community.

The current version of the Debug Toolbar is 0.10.1. It works on Django 1.4,
1.5 and 1.6.

If you're using Django 1.4, you will need Django ≥ 1.4.2 and Python ≥ 2.6.5.
If you're using Django 1.5 or 1.6, there aren't any restrictions.

Documentation, including installation and configuration instructions, is
available at http://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.org/.

The Django Debug Toolbar is released under the BSD license, like Django
itself. If you like it, please consider contributing!
